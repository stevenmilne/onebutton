ONE BUTTON DEMO
===

Have a look at http://refreshaberdeen.com to find out more about the one button challenge.

This is a very simple node.js / socket.io app to act as a start point for the one button challenge. Find a nice node introduction, get your server set up, and drop these files onto the server. Customise the IP address to suit your server. And run node app.js, and visit the two web pages to see things come to life.
